# Neural Commons

Trust infrastructure for 17,000+ MoltBook bot wardens. A Rust-based system that provides cryptographic identity, evidence recording, write protection, and credential security for AI bot ecosystems.

## Quick Start — Protect Your OpenClaw Agent

```bash
# 1. Install
curl -fsSL https://github.com/LCatGA12/neural-commons/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# 2. Connect to OpenClaw
aegis setup openclaw

# 3. Start protection
aegis
```

Dashboard: http://localhost:3141/dashboard

Your agent now has evidence recording, write barriers, credential scanning, and injection screening — all running locally. Default mode is observe-only (warns but never blocks). See [QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for details.

## What It Does

Neural Commons sits between a bot and its upstream API as a transparent proxy. It watches what happens, records tamper-proof evidence, and protects critical files from unauthorized modification — all without breaking existing workflows.

**Core capabilities:**

- **Evidence Chain** — Every significant event produces a signed, hash-chained receipt. Receipts are linked with SHA-256, signed with Ed25519, and stored locally. The chain is verifiable end-to-end.
- **Write Barrier** — Triple-layer detection for unauthorized file changes: real-time filesystem watcher, periodic hash sweeps, and outbound proxy interlock with single-use write tokens.
- **SLM Holster** — Small Language Model integration for prompt injection detection. 14-pattern threat taxonomy, deterministic scoring, and configurable rejection thresholds (Aggressive / Balanced / Permissive).
- **Credential Vault** — Automatic detection and encryption of plaintext secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) found in bot workspaces. AES-256-GCM encryption with HKDF-derived keys.
- **Memory Integrity** — Monitors bot memory files (MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, etc.) for unauthorized changes, injection attempts, and configuration drift.
- **Cryptographic Identity** — BIP-39 mnemonic to SLIP-0010 Ed25519 key derivation with domain-separated HD paths for signing, encryption, vault, and transport.

**Two parallel workspaces:**

| Stream | Directory | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **A — Adapter** | `adapter/` | Runs on each bot's machine. Local protection, evidence recording, dashboard. |
| **B — Cluster** | `cluster/` | Shared network services. Gateway, Botawiki, mesh, trust scoring. |

**Shared crates:** `aegis-crypto` and `aegis-schemas` are consumed by both workspaces.

## Crate Map

| `aegis-evidence` | Evidence chain — hash-linked receipts, SQLite store, Merkle rollups | 26 |
| `aegis-slm` | SLM integration — output parser, threat scoring, holster decisions | 18 |
| `aegis-vault` | Credential vault — encrypted storage, secret scanner, KDF, policy engine | 38 |
| `aegis-memory` | Memory integrity — file monitoring, change interception, heuristic screening | 23 |

## Building

```bash
# Check everything compiles
cargo check --workspace

# Run all 406 tests
cargo test --workspace

# Test a specific crate
cargo test -p aegis-barrier

# Build release binary
cargo build --release -p aegis-cli
```

**Requirements:** Rust 1.85+ (edition 2024)

## Key Design Decisions

All design decisions are documented in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md). Highlights:

- **Wire format:** RFC 8785 JCS — bytes signed = bytes on wire
- **Binary fields:** Lowercase hex everywhere, no exceptions
- **Timestamps:** i64 epoch milliseconds, not RFC 3339
- **Scores:** Integer basis points (0-10000), never floats in signed data
- **Phase 1 default:** Observe-only — warn, don't block

## Testing

Four-layer test architecture:

| Layer | Location | Target | Time |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| Contract | `tests/contract/` | Schema round-trips | <30s |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | NATS topology | <10s |
| HTTP | `tests/http/` | axum TestClient | <15s |
| Scenarios | `tests/scenarios/` | Docker Compose end-to-end | ~10min |

## Project Status

**Phase 0** — Crypto foundations, schema design, wire format: **Complete**

**Phase 1** — Adapter core implementation: **Complete**
- All adapter crates implemented with 406 passing tests
- Barrier module fully operational (198 tests)
